# The Advocacy Club


**The Advocacy Club** is a middle school–run movement that began at Astronova with a simple idea: young people can create real change. What started as a small group of students passionate about protecting the planet has quickly grown into an international initiative. Today, The Advocacy Club is active in 5 countries and 7 states, proving that the power of youth leadership can cross borders and inspire communities everywhere. Our mission is simple: protect wildlife, safeguard natural spaces, and advocate for smarter policies that balance human enjoyment with environmental responsibility. We don’t just talk about making a difference — we organize, educate, and take action.
Our current campaign focuses on one of the most overlooked threats to wildlife: discarded fishing line. Each year, countless birds, turtles, fish, and marine mammals suffer slow, painful deaths from entanglement, and yet this problem is completely preventable. By calling for biodegradable alternatives, recycling systems, and stronger park management, we are working to protect both wildlife and future generations. The Advocacy Club shows that when students unite — across neighborhoods, schools, and even countries — we can create lasting change. Together, we can protect every lake, river, and ocean.
